## Moving to cloud agnostic infrastructure

Sportility was moving to a new serverless cloud native architecture in order to make the system more robust, increase developer velocity and squash down technical debt.

As a result this new architecture required an entirely new way of deploying.

MPD was called in and an infrastructure as code solution was born.

The entire solution consisted of:

* Terraform
* Kubernetes
* GCP
* Istio
* Knative

Developer velocity, stability and performance were all improved with this succesful project as well as moving Sportility off of any cloud "lockin" services like AWS Lambda.
