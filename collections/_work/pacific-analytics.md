## Challenges in an emerging field

Pacific Analytics is a Bioinformatics consultancy that required a platform to run Genomic Pipelines from. This is a new and emerging field with some very immature software.

MPD was contracted to implement an open source data science platform that data scientists could use to run large pipelines.

The software is emerging and difficult to maintain so a deployment using infrastructure as code was created with the following tools.

* Ansible
* Docker
* Vagrant

This deployment allows the product to be tested and deployed reliably and in a production manner.
